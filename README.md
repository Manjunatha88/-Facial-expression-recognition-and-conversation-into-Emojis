# Facial-expression-recognition-and-conversation-into-Emojis

## Overview

"Facial-expression-recognition-and-conversation-into-Emojis" is an innovative project that bridges the gap between human emotions and digital communication. By leveraging deep learning and computer vision techniques, this project detects facial expressions in real-time and converts them into corresponding emojis. This tool is perfect for enhancing user interaction in chat applications, video conferencing, or any platform where real-time emotional feedback is valuable.

## Features

- **Real-Time Facial Expression Recognition**: Detects 7 major human facial expressions (e.g., happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, etc.) in real-time using a pre-trained deep learning model.
- **Emoji Conversion**: Automatically converts recognized facial expressions into corresponding emojis, making communication more expressive and engaging.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Simple and intuitive graphical interface for easy use, allowing users to interact with the system effortlessly.
- **Pre-Trained Model**: Utilizes a pre-trained model (`emotion_model.h5`) to recognize facial expressions accurately.
- **Customizable**: The system is designed to be easily extended with additional expressions and emojis, making it adaptable to various use cases.

## Components

- **`emotion_model.h5`**: The pre-trained deep learning model used for recognizing facial expressions.
- **`gui.py`**: The graphical user interface script that handles user interactions and displays the emoji conversion.
- **`haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`**: The Haar Cascade classifier used for detecting faces in images or video streams.
- **`train.py`**: The script used for training the facial expression recognition model. It can be modified to retrain the model with additional expressions or data.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Facial-expression-recognition-and-conversation-into-Emojis.git
```

### Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd Facial-expression-recognition-and-conversation-into-Emojis
```



### Requirements

List any major requirements that might not be covered by the requirements file, such as:
- Python 3.6+
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/Keras

## Usage

### Running the Application

1. **Start the GUI**:
   Run the GUI script to start the application:
   ```bash
   python gui.py
   ```
2. **Enable Webcam**: Allow the application to access your webcam. The system will start detecting your facial expressions in real-time.
3. **View Emojis**: As the system recognizes your expressions, it will display the corresponding emojis on the screen.

### Training the Model

If you wish to retrain the model or add new expressions:
1. **Prepare Your Dataset**: Organize your dataset with labeled images representing different expressions.
2. **Modify `train.py`**: Adjust the training parameters and dataset paths as needed.
3. **Run the Training Script**:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
4. **Update `emotion_model.h5`**: Replace the existing model with your newly trained model to see the effects in the GUI.
